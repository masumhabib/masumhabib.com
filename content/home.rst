Hi, welcome to my personal website. Here you will find information
related to my research, publications, projects and much much more. 

Currently, I hold an engineering position at Intel Corp. 
Before joining Intel, I was a Post Doctoral Research Associate affiliated 
with the department of `Electrical and Computer
Engineering <http://www.ece.virginia.edu/>`__, `University of
Virginia <http://www.virginia.edu/>`__ working with Prof. `Avik
Ghosh <http://people.virginia.edu/~ag7rq>`__ at Virginia Nano-Computing
(`VINO <http://www.ece.virginia.edu/vino>`__). I received my Ph. D. in
Electrical Engineering from University of California, Riverside in 2013
under the supervision of Prof. `Roger
Lake <http://www.ee.ucr.edu/~rlake/>`__ at Laboratory for Terascale and
Terahertz Electronics (`LATTE <http://latte.ee.ucr.edu>`__). I received
my M. Sc. and B. Sc. from the department of `Electrical and Electronic
Engineering <http://www.buet.ac.bd/eee>`__ at Bangladesh University of
Engineering and Technology (`BUET <http://buet.ac.bd>`__), Dhaka,
Bangladesh in 2009 and 2006 respectively.

My research interests include understanding, modeling and simulation of
quantum phenomena in nano-scaled electronic devices. Currently, my
research is primarily focused on the quantum transport in Graphene and
Topological Insulator based electronic devices.

In my free time, I like to read fictions, novels, news, blogs ...
virtually anything. I love to listen to music while I am working or
driving. I am also a big fan of free and open source software especially
the GNU/Linux and FreeBSD.

Thank you for showing interest in me and welcome again to my website.
