*Abstract*
--------------

We show that the interplay between chiral tunneling and spin-momentum
locking of helical surface states leads to spin amplification and
filtering in a 3D topological insulator (TI). Our calculations show that
the chiral tunneling across a TI pn junction allows normally incident
electrons to transmit, while the rest are reflected with their spins
flipped due to spin-momentum locking. The net result is that the spin
current is enhanced while the dissipative charge current is
simultaneously suppressed, leading to an extremely large, gate-tunable
spin-to-charge current ratio (âˆ¼20) at the reflected end. At the
transmitted end, the ratio stays close to 1 and the electrons are
completely spin polarized.
