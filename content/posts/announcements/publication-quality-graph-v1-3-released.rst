I am pleased to announce the release of the Publication Quality Graphs
v1.3. It is a free and open source MATLAB library for
creating beautiful, publication quality figures from instantly generated
MATLAB figures or saved MATLAB fig files. This easy to use library can
export figures in EPS, PDF, JPEG, PNG and TIFF with adjustable
resolution.

What's New in v1.3?
===================

-  Several bugs are fixed including marker spacing.
-  New options for axis color, axis line width, tick direction, tick
   length, minor ticks, legend box, legend text color etc.
-  New, more appealing default look.
