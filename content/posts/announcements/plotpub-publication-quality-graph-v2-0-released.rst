I am pleased to announce the release of the PlotPub: Publication Quality
Graphs v2.0. It is a free and open source MATLAB library for
creating beautiful, publication quality figures from instantly generated
MATLAB figures or saved MATLAB fig files. This easy to use library can
export figures in EPS, PDF, JPEG, PNG and TIFF with adjustable
resolution.

New features of v2.x
====================

-  Simple and elegant object oriented approach: all aspects of the
   MATLAB figure is encapsulated in the Plot class.
-  Create new plots, open saved figures or change existing figure using
   the same call, ``Plot()``.
-  Control every aspect of a MATLAB figure using the Plot class object.
-  Property changes are immediately visible, useful when using from the
   command window
-  Even easier to use.
-  Fully compatible to v1.x.
